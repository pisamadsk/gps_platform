# GPS Platform (JS Full Stack)

This project will be a full-stack JavaScript platform (Node.js backend, HTML/CSS/JS frontend) for real-time GPS data visualization, similar to the dashboard you shared. It will:
- Receive GPS data (from your GPS Nano device, via UDP or WebSocket)
- Display player position and trail on a football field
- Show live stats (speed, coordinates, etc.)
- Be extensible for analytics and video integration

## Structure
- `/server` - Node.js backend for data ingestion and API
- `/client` - HTML/CSS/JS frontend for visualization

## Next Steps
1. Scaffold backend and frontend folders
2. Implement UDP/WebSocket server to receive GPS data
3. Build frontend dashboard with live map and stats

Let me know if you want to customize the data protocol or add extra features!
