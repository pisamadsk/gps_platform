# GPS Platform (JS Full Stack)

This project is a full-stack JavaScript platform (Node.js backend, HTML/CSS/JS frontend) for real-time GPS data visualization and analytics. It has evolved significantly to provide a robust solution for tracking and analyzing GPS data, particularly for applications like sports performance monitoring.

## Key Features & Achievements:

-   **Secure & Seamless Real-Time Data Flow:** Established and optimized secure WebSocket communication between an ESP32 device and a Node.js server, ensuring reliable and encrypted data transmission.
-   **Intelligent Data Processing & Dynamic Visualization:** Implemented sophisticated server-side logic for parsing, validating, and broadcasting GPS data in a standardized JSON format. Developed a dynamic client-side application that provides intuitive, real-time visualization and foundational analytics of incoming data.
-   **Robust System Integration:** Achieved end-to-end system integration, meticulously ensuring data integrity and system stability across embedded systems, server, and client.

## Structure

-   `/server` - Node.js backend for data ingestion, WebSocket handling, and API.
-   `/client` - HTML/CSS/JS frontend for real-time data visualization and user interface.
